The interactive project that I have created is a simple game that has a very straight forward objective : collecting balls and avoid making them fall at all cost. The controls are simple, left and right arrow keys. In the game players are required to collect the balls in oder to survive, there are bonus blocks that will spawn occasionally that speeds the player up, allowing them to pick the balls up faster, however the balls will also spawn faster and drop faster as the player collects more balls. 

The following project is inspired by the classic game of the early days where games are rather simple at the time. 

In this following project , I took a different appraoch by coding in with tags and "custom" functions, Ive also implied logic to most of the game's mechanics. I foudn this project quite challenging as I have to create differnet tags in order to make it clear for myself to read most of it. I also find it rather challenging having to think about the logic and variable sequences.
